## ✨ Recent Feature Completions

### Off-Main-Thread Solver & PackLoader Worker
- **Completed**: Moved WASM-based route solving and data pack loading into separate Web Workers.
- **Architecture**:
  - `pack.worker.ts`: Handles fetching, caching, and sampling of environmental data packs.
  - `router.worker.ts`: Manages the C++/WASM routing engine, rebuilt with Pthread support for multi-threading.
  - `SharedArrayBuffer`: Used for zero-copy data sharing of large environmental data between workers, eliminating transfer overhead.
- **Performance Impact**:
  - The main UI thread is no longer blocked during route computations, ensuring the app remains responsive.
  - Data loading and processing are also off the main thread, improving initial load and data management performance.
- **Technical Details**:
  - Enabled Emscripten's Pthread support by recompiling the C++ core with `-pthread` flags.
  - Configured Vite with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers to enable `SharedArrayBuffer`.
  - Refactored `RouterService.ts` to act as an orchestrator for the workers.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Storybook integration** for component documentation
- **E2E testing** with Playwright
- **Bundle analysis** for optimization
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing

### Potential Additions
- **Internationalization** support
- **Advanced analytics** integration
- **Performance profiling** tools
- **Code generation** utilities
