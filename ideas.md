# Ideas for AI Novel Writer App Improvements and New Features

## Improvements to Existing Features:

1.  **Rich Text Editor Enhancements:**
    *   More Formatting Options: Add support for headings, lists (ordered/unordered), blockquotes, code blocks, and text alignment.
    *   Image/Media Embedding: Allow users to embed images or other media directly into the chapter content.
    *   Improved Undo/Redo: The current undo/redo seems to be a simple stack. A more robust implementation might handle complex formatting changes better.

2.  **Codex/Worldbuilding System Refinement:**
    *   Relationship Mapping: Allow users to define relationships between different Codex entries (e.g., Character A is from Location B, uses Magic System C). This could provide richer context for the AI.
    *   Visualizations: A graph or mind-map view of worldbuilding elements and their connections.
    *   Customizable Entry Types: Allow users to define their own custom categories and fields for worldbuilding entries beyond the predefined ones.
    *   Better Search & Filtering: More advanced search capabilities, perhaps with tags or more granular filtering.

3.  **AI Integration Enhancements:**
    *   Context Window Management: For very long novels, the AI's context window can be a limitation. Implement strategies to intelligently select the most relevant parts of the novel and Codex for AI prompts.
    *   Custom AI Prompts: Allow users to define and save their own custom AI prompts for various writing tasks.
    *   AI-driven Plotting/Outlining: AI could help generate plot points, character arcs, or outline entire chapters based on user input and existing novel data.
    *   Tone/Style Adjustment: AI features to rewrite text in a specific tone (e.g., formal, humorous, suspenseful) or style (e.g., Hemingway, fantasy epic).

4.  **User Experience & Interface:**
    *   Dark Mode: A popular feature for writing applications.
    *   Customizable Themes/Fonts: Allow users to personalize their writing environment.
    *   Drag-and-Drop for Chapters/Codex: Reordering chapters or codex entries via drag-and-drop.
    *   Improved Notifications: More visually appealing and informative notifications.

## New Features:

1.  **Version Control/History:**
    *   Implement a system to track changes to chapters over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions. This could be integrated with local storage or potentially a cloud service.

2.  **Goal Tracking & Progress Visualization:**
    *   Allow users to set daily/weekly word count goals and visualize their progress.

3.  **Character/Plot Outliners:**
    *   Dedicated sections or tools for outlining character profiles, plot points, and story arcs, separate from the main chapter content.

4.  **Research Integration:**
    *   Ability to save research notes, links, and images directly within the application, linked to specific chapters or Codex entries.

5.  **Export Options:**
    *   Export to other formats like PDF, DOCX, or Markdown, with customizable formatting.

6.  **Offline Mode (PWA enhancements):**
    *   While there's a service worker, ensuring full offline functionality and data synchronization when online could be improved.

7.  **Cloud Synchronization (Advanced):**
    *   Integrate with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) to sync novel data across devices.
