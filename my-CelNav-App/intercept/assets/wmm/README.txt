Place the official WMM coefficient file here as WMM.COF.

Get the latest from NOAA (e.g., WMM-2025) and copy the .COF text file into this directory
with the exact name WMM.COF. The app will auto-load it at startup and use it for accurate
magnetic variation (declination). If the file is absent, the app falls back to a coarse
dipole approximation.

This folder is referenced in pubspec.yaml under assets.
